Because admin and owner groups are so similar and because of time constraints due to a medical emergency  and other crap, i was only able to refactor the tests for admin and admin group but tests for user work and so do admin tests and admin group tests my string literal and uuid tests work and the all the code works except for update which i need more time to work on i didnt use the repository this time but it wont be a big deal to refactor for that. like 30 minutes and it should work about the same.
